Adds a Reactor that produces a lot of Power, is Built Instantly and for Free. 
It goes without saying that this is in no way balanced and should only be used for testing or cheating.

I know that there is a debug power option in the menu, but I find this quicker to use and allows some power grids with lots of power and some normal ones.
