Please Use that Thread for Discussion / Feedback that would like me to reply to. 
Ideally Bugs should be logged on GitHub although in the discussion thread is also fine.

Adds a Reactor that produces a lot of Power, is Built Instantly and for Free. 
It goes without saying that this is in no way balanced and should only be used for testing or cheating.

I know that there is a debug power option in the menu, but I find this more helpful for testing some things.
